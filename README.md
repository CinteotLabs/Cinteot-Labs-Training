# Cinteot Labs Training Repository


## Purpose 

This repository contains a series of tutorials that cover a variety of topics and technologies you may be working on in the lab. In each folder you will find a README markdown file that covers a specific topic. This repository is meant to get your feet wet and write some code. It is not a comprehensive study into these topics by any means and you should explore these, and other, topics on your own.



### How to move through these tutorials

```
1. Git
2.

The Voice Engine was transitioned to a web-application, and utilizes frameworks and design choices that prospective developers would need preexisting knowledge for. With that in mind, we hope to bridge the gap of knowledge for new hires using this repository. 

New hires can find basic tutorials for (Django, Bootstrap, Virtual Environments, etc) that we on the development team found to be well rounded and helpful. Along with these tutorials, we have added additional exercises where new hires can develop on branches of the Voice Engine to not only get a better feel for Django, but to also 
gain exposure to the project setup.
