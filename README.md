# VoiceEngine-Training

## Purpose 

The Voice Engine was transitioned to a web-application, and utilizes frameworks and design choices that prospective developers would need preexisting knowledge for. With that in mind, we hope to bridge the gap of knowledge for new hires using this repository. 

New hires can find basic tutorials for (Django, Bootstrap, Virtual Environments, etc) that we on the development team found to be well rounded and helpful. Along with these tutorials, we have added additional exercises where new hires can develop on branches of the Voice Engine to not only get a better feel for Django, but to also gain exposure to the project setup.
