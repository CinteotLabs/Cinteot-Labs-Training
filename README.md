# Cinteot Labs Training Repository
 

## Purpose 

This repository contains a series of tutorials that cover a variety of topics and technologies you may be working on in the lab. In each folder you will find a README markdown file that covers a specific topic. This repository is meant to get your feet wet and write some code.
