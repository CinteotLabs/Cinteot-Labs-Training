# Django Tutorial

### What is Django
Web applications have become very popular today and as a result frameworks like Django have been created to allow developers to quickly design and develop applications without having to understand lower level concepts of web development such as websockets and HTTP protocols. Frameworks like Django abstract the lower level details and do the heavy lifting so that you don't have to. Think of it as a template that you can customize into anything you want.

### Getting started with Django

#### Installing Python
Go to Python.org and download Python 3.8.2. Scroll to the bottom and select the appropriate installer based on your machine. Assuming you are on a windows machine you will use the `Windows x86-64 executable installer`.
